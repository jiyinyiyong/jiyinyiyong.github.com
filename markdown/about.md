Welcome to JiyinYiyong's homepage.

## About me

I use @题叶 and [@jiyinyiyong](https://github.com/jiyinyiyong) on the web. I make things with ClojureScript and work using TypeScript. I live in Shanghai.

## Projects

I'm running several exploring projects:

* [Respo](http://github.com/Respo), a virtual DOM library
* [Cumulo](https://github.com/Cumulo/), a tiny workflow for realtime apps
* [Cirru](https://github.com/Cirru/), structual code editing
* [Quamolit/phlox](http://quamolit.org/), some canvas works

Some of my tiny pieces can be found on:

* [TopixIM](https://github.com/TopixIM/)
* [Memkits](https://github.com/memkits)
* [MVC Works](https://github.com/mvc-works/)

Meanwhile I'm also help maintaining some forums:

* [React China](http://react-china.org/)
* [ClojureVerse](http://clojureverse.org)
* [Clojure China](http://clojure-china.org)

## Contacts

I'm very interested in Functional Programming. My job is a Web developer. You may find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jiyinyiyong) and [Weibo](http://weibo.com/jiyinyiyong/).

Most of the time I'm joining React and ClojureScript communities, but we don't have a stable offline community yet.

## Sharings

I have several blogs:

I do sharings, mostly in Shanghai and related to React and ClojureScript. Sometimes to my friends, and sometimes for the company I work for.
